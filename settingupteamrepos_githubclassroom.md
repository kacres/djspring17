# Using Github Classroom to set up your Team Repositories

[Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) allows teachers to create individual assignments and group assignments that can be given to teams of students, to work on them in private or public repositories.

In this short guide we use a story assignment as the example case to show you how to set up the team repository. In less than five minutes you will have a private repository to build your story, create a wiki, log issues and build a project board. Everything that will be submitted will be included in the team repository.

## 1. Get the team repository link and sign in Github

You will receive a link (something like `http://classroom.github.com/group-assignment-invitations/something`) in an email from your instructor to create your team repository. After you click on the link, the Github page will ask you to sign up for an account or sign in to your existing account.

## 2. Create your team

The next screen will ask you to accept the assignment, in this case "storiesrepo".

Your instructor will assign you to a team and one person will be designated to create the team.

When your team has been created, click on it to join. Make sure you choose the proper team!

Welcome to your team repository for the story you are going to create. Follow the directions to creating the story.

Your instructors will be added automatically to the repository and will be able to watch your assignment progress.
